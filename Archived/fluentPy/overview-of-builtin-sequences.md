# Overview of Built-in Sequences 

## { Container Sequences } | hold items of different types
+ list sequences 
+ tuple sequences 
+ collections.deque sequences 

## { Flat Sequences } | hold items of one type (more compact but are limited to holding primitive values like characters, bytes and numbers. 
+ str 
+ bytes
+ bytearray 
+ memoryview
+ array.array

## Mutable Sequences 
+ list 
+ bytearray
+ array.array
+ collections.deque
+ memory view

## Immutable sequences
+ tuple
+ str
+ bytes 

## Note: built-in (concrete) sequence types do not actually 'subclass' the Sequence and MutableSequence abstract base classes
